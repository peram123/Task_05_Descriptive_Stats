Prompt 9:
If the coach wants to win 2 more games in 2025, should they focus on offense or defense? Which player could help most?

Expected Answer:
Based on the 2025 data:

Offense appears to be the more strategic focus:

No player scored more than 34 goals, and the top scorer (Emma Muchnick) had 34 goals but only 7 assists.

Emma Ward, while not the top goal scorer, contributed 30 goals and 46 assists, leading to 76 total points‚Äîmaking her the most well-rounded offensive contributor.

Several key players have high shooting accuracy (DeVito, Sam: 0.917, Britton, Gracie: 0.805) but relatively low shot volume, indicating underutilized offensive potential.

Defense data is limited (no explicit stats like caused turnovers, saves, or goals-against average), but:

Several players had high turnover counts (e.g., Emma Ward: 41, Emma Muchnick: 31), suggesting defensive improvement (ball retention and pressure handling) could reduce possession losses.

üëâ Recommendation:
Focus on offensive coordination‚Äîmaximize contributions from high-efficiency shooters like Sam DeVito and leverage Emma Ward‚Äôs playmaking (46 assists) to convert more possessions into goals.
LLM Response:
To win 2 more games in 2025, the coach should focus on offense. 
Players like Emma Ward, who contributed both high goal and assist totals (30 goals, 46 assists), and Sam DeVito, who had the highest shooting efficiency (0.917), 
could significantly boost scoring impact. Improving offensive execution and leveraging high-efficiency shooters could convert close games into wins.

Validation: ‚úÖ 
orrect. The LLM correctly analyzed available data, inferred offensive strengths, 
and identified key players who could contribute most toward improving game outcomes.
